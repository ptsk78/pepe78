Or as I call it - "Unexpected emergence of Gaussians out of everywhere :)"

Left - Input (pdf) - [Continuous uniform distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_uniform_distribution)

Right - Output (pdf) - You take many of them (sequencies) and compute their averages, and those averages form a [Gaussian / Normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)

Trippy, huh?

And it gets trippier - input can have any shape, not only uniform distribution, and the averages of the sequencies from input form again Gaussian / Normal distribution:
